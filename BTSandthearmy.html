       I always wondered why people were so crazy about the kpop world when all they had was 
       just pretty faces. I used to say I don't listen to kpop but the fact that we were all
       jamming to <span style="font-weight: bold;">oppa gangnam style!</span> to the point where this was the song played
       in all our Indian Weddings and all the fufa and chacha were dancing to this song doing 
       the gangnam style(the horse style dance) and find it was hypocritical of us and just 
       diss all the efforts put in by these artists.

        The more I got to know about the hard work and their struggles, the more I got into kpop more.
        The first Kpop artist I stanned was <span style="font-weight: bold;">BTS</span>. I know the 
        non-kpopers must be wondering what is stanning well it's a mixture of stalk and fan.
        The influence of army is quite big on the world and everybody wants to becoem friends with 
        this fandom nobody wants to mess with this fandom. A couple of days ago when BTS released
         their collaboration JasonDerulo and the song hit the top of the charts everywhere, Jason
        was slammed by the army saying that BTS was the one that got him to the top of the charts 
        and he didn't bother sayin ga thank you to them and partied and gave all the credit to himself. 
        The army was angry and JasonDerulo understood that it would be difficult to deal with the 
        angry Bts army he made a post on the social media thanking BTS but it was too late fo that 
        and the cow had already drowned in the water.

    <p>Everybody says mess with whoever you wanna mess with but never mess with the army. </p>
